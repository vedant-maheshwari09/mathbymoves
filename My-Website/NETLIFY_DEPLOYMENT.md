# Netlify Deployment Guide for Chess Portfolio

## Essential Files for Netlify Upload

You need to upload these files to your Netlify site:

### Core Configuration Files
1. `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
2. `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
3. `package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
4. `vite.config.netlify.ts` - Vite build configuration for static hosting
5. `build-netlify.js` - Custom build script for deployment

### Source Code (Complete project structure)
- `client/` folder - All frontend components and pages
- `attached_assets/` folder - Your chess photos and images
- `components.json` - UI component configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - CSS processing configuration

### Modified Components for Static Hosting
- `client/src/App-netlify.tsx` - Static-only app component
- `client/src/main-netlify.tsx` - Entry point for Netlify
- `client/src/pages/home-netlify.tsx` - Homepage using static contact form
- `client/src/components/contact-section-netlify.tsx` - Contact form that opens email client

## Key Changes for Netlify

### Contact Form Behavior
- **Original**: Server-side email verification with database storage
- **Netlify**: Direct mailto links that open visitor's email client
- **Result**: Visitors compose emails in their default email app, sending directly to mathbymoves@gmail.com

### Build Process
- Uses custom build script that creates static assets
- Removes server-side dependencies
- Maintains all visual design and functionality
- Preserves your chess photo and portfolio content

## Deployment Steps

1. **Create Netlify Account**: Sign up at netlify.com
2. **Upload Files**: Drag and drop your project folder to Netlify dashboard
3. **Build Settings**: Netlify will automatically use the netlify.toml configuration
4. **Domain**: Netlify provides a free subdomain (e.g., yoursite.netlify.app)

## What Works on Netlify
- ✅ Complete portfolio display with your chess photo
- ✅ All sections: Hero, About, Achievements, Classes, Contact
- ✅ Professional design and responsive layout
- ✅ Contact form validation and email composition
- ✅ Google Analytics integration (when VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID is added)
- ✅ Fast loading and global CDN distribution

## What Changes on Netlify
- Contact form opens email client instead of server-side verification
- No email verification step (visitors send emails directly)
- Static hosting (no server-side processing)

Your chess portfolio will work perfectly on Netlify with all the professional presentation intact.
